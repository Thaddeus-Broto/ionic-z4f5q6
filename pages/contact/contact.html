   <h2> How Reﾌ《oudre Works: </h2>

   <p>
    The Reﾌ《oudre app was created using coding from StackBlitz. The app utilizes HTML for display, Javascript for the variables and CSS for the design and aesthetics of the interface. The application works when two amounts, the original price and selling price, are entered. The codes use a basic formula that subtracts the 'Original Price' from the 'Selling Price' to get the 'Savings'. The Marketdown Rate is computed when 'Savings' and 'Selling Price' are divided and then multiplied by 100.
