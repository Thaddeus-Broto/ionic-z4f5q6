    This is a Markdown Calculator app. Markdown is a reduction of the product price, basing on the inability to sell it at the initial price or original selling price. In other words, markdown is the difference between the original retail price and the actual selling price.

   <h2> How Résoudre Works: </h2>

   <p>
    The Résoudre app was created using coding from StackBlitz. The app utilizes HTML for display, Javascript for the variables and CSS for the design and aesthetics of the interface. The application works when two amounts, the original price and selling price, are entered. The codes use a basic formula that subtracts the 'Original Price' from the 'Selling Price' to get the 'Savings'. The Marketdown Rate is computed when 'Savings' and 'Selling Price' are divided and then multiplied by 100.
